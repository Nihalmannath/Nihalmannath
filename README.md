## Hi there 👋
Architect by experience, with a natural draw toward coding—now quietly seeking the balance where both passions meet.
  
# Designing with Intelligence
Curious about how intuition and algorithms can co-author architecture — letting buildings learn, adapt, and evolve.

# Mapping Invisible Cities
Drawn to the hidden patterns of urban life — networks, flows, behaviors — and how data can reveal them.

# Giving Tools a Brain
Not just using software — but embedding reasoning, learning, and conversation into the design pipeline.

# Crafting with Code
Seeing code as material — shaping structure, space, and behavior from digital grains.

# Rewriting the Architect’s Role
Challenging static workflows — imagining new tools, processes, and agency in a tech-driven design world.

# Connecting Worlds
Merging architecture, AI, simulation, and storytelling — blurring lines between model, city, and experience.
