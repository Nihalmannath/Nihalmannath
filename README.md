## Architect by experience, with a natural draw toward coding now quietly seeking the balance where both passions meet.
  
### Designing with Intelligence
"Curious about how intuition and algorithms can co-author architecture,letting buildings learn, adapt, and evolve."

### Mapping Invisible Cities
"Drawn to the hidden patterns of urban life / networks, flows, behaviors, and how data can reveal them."

### Giving Tools a Brain
"Not just using software but embedding reasoning, learning, and conversation into the design pipeline."

### Crafting with Code
"Seeing code as material shaping structure, space, and behavior from digital grains."

### Rewriting the Architect’s Role
"Challenging static workflows — imagining new tools, processes, and agency in a tech-driven design world."

### Connecting Worlds
"Merging architecture, AI, simulation, and storytelling, blurring lines between model, city, and experience."
